# WrapETH

# What is WrapETH?

This is a front-end that calls `deposit` and `withdraw` functions on various wrapped ETH smart contracts, depending on which blockchain the user is connected to. Users can switch between various EVM chains and wallets, and swap the chain's native token for its wrapped native token, and vice versa.

* Raid Guild and WrapETH do not own the smart contracts being called by this UI.
* WrapETH does not hold custody of funds, nor create or send tokens.
